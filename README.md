# PHASE-1-PROJECT
This is the project done by Tracy Mumbi Naomi as required for the completion of the first section of Software Engineering course in Moringa School, Nairobi, Kenya.

## RECIPE APP
The objective of this projct is to provide the user with an app where they can get recipies for different types of food and they are able to see the instructions for cooking the foods

## Guide on how to run the application
What you need to get started
Have node js installed on your computer.
Use this to get instructions on how to install node.
Have json-server installed on your computer.
Use this to get instructions on how to install json-server.
Use any code editor that has similar or more capability to VS code.
I recommend you use VS code editor with the live server extension.

Running the project
Fork and clone this repository in to your computer
Open the project-folder using VS code.
Click on Go Live at the bottom right of the VS code window.
This will open your default browser and display the contents of the index.html.
Expect to see "Waiting for the server..." dispayed.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. ie.".../phase-1-week-3-project$"
Run json-server --watch lib.json or json-server lib.jsonin the terminal
Go back to the browser tab where the index.html loaded and refresh the page.
A list of book titles should appear.

Navigating through the project
From this point, you can:

Explore the books and the categories.
"Give out" a book.
Add and remove copies of a book available and owned by the library.
Delete all records a book from the server/API.
Refer to this video(ap3) for more on this.


Criteria met
A well documented readme that any developer can use.
This project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
20 + commits in the project with well detailed commit messages.
The project contains a single HTML file.
This project incorporates at least 3 separate event listeners.
DOMContentLoaded : in javascript to load the script
Click : in javascript for all the buttons in the project
Change : in javascript for the input (search bar) and selection menu
Hover : in css file for the list items
Focus : in css for the input (search bar)
Well designed landing page that shows a list of books (when connected to the server), a search bar, and a selection menu of the categories available in the library.
Follows good coding practices by keeping code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
